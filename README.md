💻 Best Calculator: A Simple & Functional Web ToolThis is a responsive and user-friendly web calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides all the essential arithmetic functions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and also supports exponentiation (power) and square root calculations.✨ FeaturesStandard Arithmetic: Perform basic operations like $+$, $-$, $*$, and $/$.Scientific Functions: Includes a power operator (**) for exponentiation and a dedicated button for square root ($\sqrt{}$).Input Handling:Clear button (C) to reset the display.Delete button ($\leftarrow$) to remove the last character.Logic to prevent multiple consecutive operators (e.g., 5++5 becomes 5+5).Error Management: Displays "Error" for invalid expressions.Minimalist Design: Clean, intuitive, and easy-to-use interface.🚀 Technologies UsedHTML5: Structure of the calculator interface.CSS3: Styling for a clean, modern look.JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Core logic for handling button presses, managing the display, and performing calculations using the built-in eval() function (with basic error handling).🛠️ How to Use (Code Overview)The core functionality is managed by simple JavaScript functions:appendToResult(val): Appends the pressed button value to the display, with logic to handle and replace sequential operators.calculateResult(): Evaluates the expression in the display using eval() and updates the result. It also includes a try...catch block for error handling.clearResult() & deleteLast(): Manage clearing the full display or the last character, respectively.💡 To Do / Future EnhancementsImplement proper parsing for the 'square root' function instead of relying on a simple text output.Add parenthesis support for complex calculations.Improve error handling and validation (e.g., division by zero).
